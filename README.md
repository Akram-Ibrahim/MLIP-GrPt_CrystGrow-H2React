# MLIP-GrPt_CrystGrow-H2_Sensing

> **Platinum-functionalized graphene** combines ultra-high carrier mobility with Pt‚Äôs catalytic activity for chemiresistive H‚ÇÇ detection, but connecting synthesis, morphology, and sensor metrics at the atomistic level is challenging. We trained an equivariant neural network potential with near-DFT accuracy to run large-scale MD simulations of Pt PVD crystal growth on graphene and subsequent H‚ÇÇ sensing, establishing a predictive pipeline from deposition conditions through nanocluster structure to chemiresistive performance.

## Overview
This repository provides:
- **Equivariant NNP workflows** for training and deploying machine-learned interatomic potentials.  
- **MD pipelines** for Pt physical-vapor-deposition (PVD) crystal growth on graphene.  
- **H‚ÇÇ-sensing simulations** on Pt/graphene devices.  
- Tools to compute key figures of merit:
  - **Response time** & **Recovery time**  
  - **Limit of detection** 
  - **Transduction sensitivity**
